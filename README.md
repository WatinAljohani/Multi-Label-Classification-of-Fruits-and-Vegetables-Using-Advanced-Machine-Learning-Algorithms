# Multi-Label Classification of Fruits and Vegetables Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms

## Project Description
This project aims to classify images of fruits and vegetables based on their type (apple, banana, tomato, cucumber) and condition (fresh, rotten).

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the necessary files, including the Colab notebook, from the provided zipped folder.
2. Extract the contents of the zipped folder.
3. Open the Colab notebook to begin.

## Usage Instructions
1. Download the dataset to your device.
2. Upload the dataset to Google Colab.
3. Use the provided code in the first cell of the notebook to unzip the dataset. No need to change any paths in the code, as they are preconfigured to work with the setup described.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 480 images of different fruits and vegetables, divided into training and testing sets:
- **Training Set**: 384 images across 8 categories (fresh and rotten apples, bananas, tomatoes, and cucumbers), each containing 48 images, totaling 96 images per fruit type.
- **Testing Set**: 96 images across 8 categories (fresh and rotten apples, bananas, tomatoes, and cucumbers), each containing 12 images, totaling 24 images per fruit type.

## Report Information
A PDF final report is included in the zipped folder.

## Requirements/Dependencies
The notebook includes all necessary Python libraries.
